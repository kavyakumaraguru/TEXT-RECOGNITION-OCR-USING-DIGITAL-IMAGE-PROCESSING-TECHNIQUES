# TEXT-RECOGNITION-OCR-USING-DIGITAL-IMAGE-PROCESSING-TECHNIQUES
The objective of text recognition is to recognize the text from printed hardcopy document to preferred format. recognizing a text is a very easiest job for humans, but in a machine or electric device that does text recognition is a challenging task. the major steps involved in text recognition is pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, classification. to attain high speed in data processing it is essential to convert the analog data into digital data. The process of Text Recognition involves several steps including preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, classification, post processing. Preprocessing is for done the basic operation on input image like binarization which convert gray Scale image into Binary Image, noise reduction which remove the noisy  nature from image. Segmentation stage for segment the given image into line by line and segment each character from segmented line. Future extraction calculates the characteristics of character. A classification contains the database and does the comparison. storage of hard copy of any document occupies large space and retrieving of information from that document is time consuming.
